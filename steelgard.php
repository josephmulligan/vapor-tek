                    <h2>Steelgard Export</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        In the past, the prevention of corrosion of metal parts and machinery destined for export, or subject to long periods of storage under adverse conditions, has been a fairly crude affair.
                        <br>
                        <br> Until now, those responsible for ensuring that goods are delivered to the customer in perfect condition have been stuck (sometimes literally!) with thick heavy difficult-to-apply coatings of variable and often poor quality.
                        <br>
                        <br> Following years of research and field trials, Vapor-Tek have developed the solution in the form of Steelgard Export.
                        <br>
                        <br> Steelgard protects all major metals and alloys, is easy to apply, spreads and penetrates, is water displacing, neutralises fingerprints, coats complete assemblies, protects the whole thing, saves time, assists with quality control.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>No More Sticky or Messy Coatings</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br> Steelgard Export’s thin and transparent film affords a much higher level of protection than the old-fashioned methods involving thick heavy coatings which can be difficult, messy and time-consuming to apply – and even worse to remove.

                        <strong>
                            A HIGHLY INHIBITED CORROSION PREVENTIVE GREASE
                            FORMULATED FOR THE PROTECTION OF BOTH FERROUS &amp; NON-FERROUS METALS
                        </strong>
                        <br>
                        <br> Steelgard RP Grease is a blend of organic inhibitors in a highly refined mineral oil.
                        <br>
                        <br> Also Incorporated are oxidation inhibitors, age resistors, penetrating aids and metals’ deactivators.
                        <br>
                        <br> Corrosion tests clearly demonstrate that both ferrous and non-ferrous metals are protected against salt water, high humidities, acid pollution, galvanic and crevice corrosion.
                        <br>
                        <br> The degree of protection is of a much higher order than that found with conventional greases.
                        <br>
                        <br> The composition is both pseudoplastic and thixotropic and has a controlled degree of syneresis.
                        <br>
                        <br> The combination of these properties give Steelgard RP Grease quite unique rheological properties, which are ideally suited to corrosion prevention in extreme circumstances and environments.
                        <br>
                        <br> The unique combination of properties of Steelgard RP Grease, in particular its penetrating and lubricating properties and its ability to protect a wide range of ferrous and non-ferrous metals against all forms of atmospheric corrosion, suggests that it has uses in many areas of corrosion prevention.

                        Functions in a manner similar to Vaporol, but uses water in place of oil as the “carrier”. Its uses include preservation of items such as pumps, fire extinguishers, gas cylinders, boilers, pipework, heat exchangers and hydraulic systems.
                        <br>
                        <br> Also finds use in the prevention of corrosion of packaged metal parts during storage and transportation.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        For use during pressure and flow testing. Used in diluted form, usually 1% to 2% in water to render it harmless and non-corrosive to most ferrous and non-ferrous metals and alloys.

                        <br>
                        <br> This is especially useful for overseas customers since it greatly reduces freight costs.
